\title{A Brief Note on Gravitational Waves}
\maketitle

\section{Introduction}

% Here we use an INSPIRE KEY
The first direct detection of gravitational waves from a binary black hole
merger was reported by the LIGO and Virgo collaborations
\cite{LIGOScientific:2016aoc}.

% Here we use an ADS key
Subsequent observations have greatly expanded the catalogue of compact binary
mergers \cite{2025ApJ...995L..18A}.

% And here we are using the arXiv key
This paper also cites a recent preprint using its arXiv ID directly
\cite{2508.18081}.
